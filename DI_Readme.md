## Understanding DI

# Patterns to follow for DI

### 0. Install the XUnit.DI package
### 1. Create Startup file
### 2. Add the method ConfigureServices
### 3. Make your existing Concrete class with an Interfaces
### 4. Declare the Interfaces and Concrete class in the ConfigureServices method in startup file
### 5. To Access the Concrete file, you need to use it from within Constructor (pretty much like Specflows Context injection)
